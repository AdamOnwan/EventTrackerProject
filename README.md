# EventTrackerProject
### Overview
To give hosts opportunity to take in pet owners pets and take care of them while the pet owners are away, usually for a profit. Also vice versa, give pet owners convenience of searching for reputable pet hosts or other services for their pets.
### How to use
1. User starts on landing page.
2. User can search or register/login
3.  If register/login
-  User registers as a client user or service user
-  User logs in
4. After register/login
 - Client user fills out information such as the pet they have
 - Service user fills out information  such as availability, services and type of stay for pet.
 - User lands onto profile page and able to perform CRUD on profile
5. Client user conducts search for services for their pet
 - *Note* Only Denver CO has hardcoded dummy information on pet owners/hosts in the database so searching by city and state other than Denver CO may not show any information
6. User picks a service they want to have done to their pet while in the search menu by clicking on reserve button, which only shows when a user is logged in and has a pet
7. User picks dates to reserve for the service and receives a confirmation message.
8. User can go into profile and check reservation history and give the host a review and rating, and the host can do the same for the pet they serviced.
